# Technical Understanding
A regression problem, targeting a continuous variable, using financial(also continuous) features, modeled using Muliple Linear Regression with Stepwise, Lasso selection, Decision Trees with Random Forest Regression selection and GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning. 

# Business Understanding
In [Public Act 102-0570](https://ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=102-0570), Illinois' General Assembly has commissioned the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE) to offer "specific data-driven criteria and approaches to the General Assembly to adequately, equitably, and stably fund public universities in this State and to evaluate existing funding methods." This Commision on Equitable Public University Funding (CEPUF) coincides with the [A Thriving Illinois: Higher Education Paths to Equity, Sustainability, and Growth] (https://ibhestrategicplan.ibhe.org/IBHE-Strategic-Plan-2021.html) which includes providing "equitable funding so that students can receive the best educational experience and succeed at whichever institution they attend," and funding "institutions sufficiently to achieve student, institutional, and state goals."

This project targets 6-year black bachelors graduation rates for first-time, full-time students-- the typical measure for college student success-- using U.S. public and private university data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). This project aims to offer data-driven advice on how Illinois' universities might better leverage their financials towards black student success.
